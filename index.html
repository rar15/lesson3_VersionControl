            <p class="lead">Version Control is when you have only one repository that contains all of the files that you are working on. The advantages of this that it is a very efficient way to share and edit files between people. It allows one user to pull and edit a file that someone else has used. The VCS allows you to have your own copy of the files, but also allows other users to edit theirs. The VCS keeps track of the last date it was editied, who editied it, what changes were made to the file, and it also allows you to go back to a previous file after it has been edited.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Repositories are places to store files or projects when using text editing software. These repositories can be either individual ones that only you can access or community ones that allow multiple users to access. A remote repository is one that is shared among many users and allows team members to access your files from a remote server that is only shared among those certain team members. Local repositories are a repository that is specific for you. Only you are allowed to access the files on this and it is organized how you would like it. When you are making this local repository, you are allowed to either create an entirely new repository or clone an existing one. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">GIT</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is one of the main version control systems that are in use today. GIT is a distributed version control system that allows you to create local brances, a staging area, and local workflows. With this VCS every user is allowed to have a complete copy of the files in the repository that they can work on or make changes to. These changes are logged to the repository and are allowed to be accessed by other users in your team in order to see what changes you have made. Since all of the files in the repository are local, you are allowed to access and work on these files offline. One major advantage is that GIT can prevent any unintentional overwrite of a filed on the shared repository. This means that you won't be caught off gaurd with changes to a document that you did not make. </p>

                <span class="text-muted">Basic GIT commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There is sort of an order that Git commands need to be entered in order to get what you have been working on from the local repository to the remote repository. First you need to use the "git init" command to initialize the repository. Then you need to use the command "git remote add origin __" where the __ is the url where you want git to add a remote place called 'origin'. Next you need to used the command "git add ." in order to add the files that were changed to the staging area. After that, the command "git commit -m '...'" where the '...' is the repository you want to commit the changes to. Then you need to use the "git push" command in order to push the changes you have made in the local repository to the remote repository. And finally if you want to pull the changes in a file from the remote repository to the local repository, you would use the "git pull" command. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">More of the complex Git commands were also covered in this lesson as well. Some of these other commands include "git status","git blame_", and "git diff". "git status" is a command that will show all of the files that were changed from the last backup and which ones are heading for the staging area. "git blame_" is a command that allows the user to see who wrote each line of the code or who is to blame for that line of code. "git diff" shows the difference between working with the back-ups created in the repository and the working directory.</p>
